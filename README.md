# hello-world
I am an early stage software developer with aspirations of developing software for individuals and businesses around the world.  
So far I have covered the basics of HTML and CSS. Now that I have covered the fundamentals of the framework of these languages, I hope to use GitHub to further my education and knowledge of software development. Most importantly, I am excited to collaborate with other brilliant minds out there with resources and passion for helping other eager developers like myself.
